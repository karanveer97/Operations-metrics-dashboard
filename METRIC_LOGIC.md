# Metric Definitions & Logic

This document explains how key operational metrics were defined
and calculated in this project.

## SLA Compliance %
Percentage of tickets resolved within the defined SLA time.

Formula:
(Resolved within SLA / Total resolved tickets) * 100

## Average Turnaround Time (TAT)
Average time taken to resolve a ticket from creation to closure.

## Backlog Volume
Number of open tickets pending resolution at the end of the day.

## Daily Throughput
Total number of tickets resolved per day.

## SLA Breach Count
Count of tickets where resolution time exceeded the SLA threshold.

## Assumptions
- SLA threshold assumed as per standard ops practice
- Working hours are considered consistently
- The dataset is simulated for learning and demonstration purposes
